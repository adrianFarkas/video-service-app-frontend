# Video Service App

### About
This project was an assignment for codecool. 
We had to create a basic app where you can see list of the uploaded videos which all
was youtube links and we a page where you can watch the video and leave recommendation(comment, rate).

After this assigment I decided to modify the app so that users could upload their own videos like on YouTube.

The app is not finished yet. I keep improving it.

**Technologies what i used**
* React framework
* Spring framework
* Hibernate
* PostgreSQL
* AWS S3 Bucket (To store files)

This repository contains the frontend.

You can check the [Backend repository](https://github.com/adrianFarkas/video-service-app) on this link.

It's also deployed on Heroku: [Cool Video](https://cool-video.herokuapp.com/)
